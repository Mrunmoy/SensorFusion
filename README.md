# üåê DIY Sensor Node

This project is an exploration into creating a low-power, interconnected sensor network using an ESP32 microcontroller (later change over to nRF82540) and a GY-87 sensor module (make it battery powered rechargeable node). The goal is to build a device with advanced sensing capabilities, including movement detection and relative positioning within a swarm of similar nodes.

### Key Features

* **Low-power design:** Focuses on efficiency for extended use.
* **Motion & Orientation Sensing:** Utilizes the GY-87 (MPU-6050 and HMC5883L) for 9-axis motion data.
* **Swarm Connectivity:** Explores peer-to-peer communication between nodes to determine relative positions.
* **Versatile Applications:** The sensor data can be used for a wide range of creative and experimental applications.

### Potential Use Cases

The data and capabilities of this project could be applied to various fun and educational applications, such as:

* **Motion Capture:** Tracking the movement of objects or body parts for animation or digital art projects.
* **Shadow Control:** Creating interactive lighting or display effects based on physical movement.
* **Machine Learning:** Gathering data to train models for unique applications or games.
* **Location Awareness:** Building a personal tracking system for items or pets.

### Technical Design Ideas üõ†Ô∏è

As this project evolves, several key architectural components are envisioned to enhance its functionality and ease of use:

#### 1. Over-The-Air (OTA) Bootloader

A primary design goal is to implement a custom **bootloader** that supports **Over-The-Air (OTA) updates**. This will allow for seamless firmware upgrades of the sensor nodes without needing physical access. This is crucial for:

* **Field deployment:** Updating nodes distributed in various locations.
* **Iterative development:** Easily pushing new features, bug fixes, or experimental code to all nodes.
* **Flexibility:** Adapting the node's behavior to different project requirements.

#### 2. Intelligent Sensor Application

The core application running on each ESP32 node will be designed to handle sophisticated sensor management:

* **Sensor Polling:** Actively read data from the onboard GY-87 sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) at defined intervals.
* **Data Fusion:** Implement algorithms (e.g., Kalman filters, complementary filters) to **fuse** the raw sensor data, generating more robust and accurate information regarding the node's orientation, movement, and relative position. This fusion helps to reduce noise and overcome individual sensor limitations.
* **Information Relay:** The processed and meaningful data will then be **relayed** to a central processing unit. This could be:
    * Another designated "master" node in the swarm.
    * A nearby computer for real-time visualization and analysis.
    * A Raspberry Pi for further local processing, data logging, or integration into larger systems.

This architecture ensures that each node is intelligent enough to process its local environment, contributing valuable, refined data to the overall system.
